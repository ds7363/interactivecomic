Project Name: A trip to the moon
Project Description: This project aims to provide user with a fun interactive story about a trip from earth to the moon. After the user starts scrolling down, the rocket goes off from earth and flies through space. We can see it going next to satellites and the finally next to the moon where the user must press a button for it to land. After that the user is prompted with 3 choices to continue the story where each choice resembles a different comic that has a different ending.
Process: The process of creating this website started off with a simple sketch which I did on an Ipad app called Freeform. From that sketch I drew up the svgs that we would use later while implementing it into the site. I used Adobe Illustrator to complete this task. After I had the svgs ready, my teammate Shahram drew up the comics for the storyline and my teammate Sophie combined all the elements along with providing the basic animations for the rocket. My job then was to finish the selection menu, create hyperlinks and create the other pages for the sotryline comics. I also had to work on the moon landing animation.
Reflection/Evaluation: Overall I think that this project was definately very fun, especially because it is something that I have never done before. It was interesting to see and learn how we can play with svgs while also learning about storytelling through comics.
